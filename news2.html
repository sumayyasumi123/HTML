    <p><strong>Date :</strong>17-Oct-2025</p>
    <p>Kerala has officially kicked off Yaanam 2025: Tales, Trails & Journeys, the country’s first-ever travel literature festival, today in Varkala.  Organised by Kerala Tourism, the three-day event runs from October 17 to 19 at Ranga Kala Kendram, perched on the scenic Varkala Cliff. 

The festival aims to weave together literature, travel, culture, and sustainable tourism by bringing in writers, artists, vloggers, photographers, and travel enthusiasts from across India and abroad.  Highlights include storytelling sessions, interactive panel discussions (such as “In Search of Stories and Characters”), workshops on writing, photography and wellness, curated discovery trails through hidden gems of Varkala, live performances, artisan markets, and cultural immersions. 

Prominent personalities expected to speak or perform at Yaanam include Booker Prize winner Shehan Karunatilaka, journalist-author Pallavi Aiyar, Sri Lankan writer Andrew Fidel Fernando, poet Prof. Nathalie Handal, Tibetan poet Tenzin Tsundue, among others.  Kerala’s Tourism Minister P. A. Mohamed Riyas emphasized that the festival is part of a broader plan to showcase Varkala’s potential to the world, and has backed the event with a ₹25 crore project to improve tourism infrastructure in the region. 

Yaanam is being conceptualised by author and curator Sabin Iqbal and programmed by writer Nirmala Govindarajan, known for her evocative travel-inspired writing.  The festival promises to be an immersive experience for both creators and travellers, combining the magic of storytelling with the joy of exploration and sustainable travel</p>
